The following files are used for sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the report:

- Sess1_part1_generate_data.m: necessary to generate all the data for the following ex-periments.

- Sess1_part1_calc_estimators.m: computes the IV and LS estimators.

- Sess1_part1.m: recreates the experiments and generates the plots.


The following files are used for section 1.3 of the report: 

- Sess1_part2_generate_data.m: necessary to generate all the data for the following ex-periments.

- Sess1_part2_calc_estimators.m: computes the LS, IV and EIV estimators.

- Sess1_part2.m: recreates the experiments and generates the plots.

The generated figures are saved in the folder Session1/figures/

The following files are used:

- Sess2.m: recreates the experiments and generates the plots.

- Sess2_assump.m: compares the results with and without the assumption that the system isinitially at rest.

The generated figures are saved in the folder Session2/figures/
