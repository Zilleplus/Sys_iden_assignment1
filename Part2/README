SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION AND MODELING - PART 2

  Initialization.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
(*) Sess3_init.m : indicate the path.

(*) identification_init.m : all the identification scripts start with running identification_init.m, this script loads the matrices with test data.



  Simulation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
(*) simulate_data_2.m : the input-ouput data can be generated by running the file simulate_data_2.m, which uses the function ’simulate’ (simulate.m). As it takes some time to run theses files, we recommend you to not generate these data, as they are already saved in simulation_data_3.mat, which is loaded with the initialization file.  

(*) Plot_inputdesign.m : the different outputs created by the system can be seen on the plots generated by this file.



  Preprocessing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
(*) fun_preprocessing.m : the preprocessing steps are performed with this function.



  Identification and validation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For every model x (where x is arx, armax, OE, BJ or subspace) we have the following files:

(*) fun_x_model.m : generates the model with the specified order and computes the criteria of section 3.1 (see report).

(*) identification_x_generate_table.m : generates the tables with the fit and AIC values (uses matrix2latex.m).

(*) identification_x.m : starts with the identification of the model with orders determined from the table. It then generates a graph with the Bode plot of the real system and the estimated model.

For the Box-Jenkins model, an extra function that generates a graph (as explained in the report)is included (see identification_BJ_generate_graph.m).



  Bode plot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

(*) bodedata.mat : data for plotting the Bode graph.

(*) generate_data_bode_plot.m:  generate the bodedata.mat file.

(*) fun_bode_plot_dual.m : plots the experimental bode plot with the bode plot of model. 

(*) fun_bode_plot plots.m : the experimental bode plot with the bode plots of 2 models.
